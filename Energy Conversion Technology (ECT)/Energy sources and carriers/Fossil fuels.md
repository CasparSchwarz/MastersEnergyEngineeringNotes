## Coal genisis
### Aerobic genisis
- Degradation by bacteria and fungi
- Oxygen is involved 
- Peat is formed

### Anaerobic genisis
- The genisis is sealed from the air
- Microscopic organisms are still involved in the genesis
- Lignite is formed

### Coalification
- Under high pressure and temperature hard coal (anthracite) is formed

## Properties of coal
### Peat
- Soft and easy to compress
- Can be used as fuel when pre-dired
- High water content
- High O-Content
- Low C-Content

### Lignite
- High water content
- High O-content
- Low C-content
- High volatile content

### Sub-bimtuminous coal
- Low water content
- Average O-content
- Average C-vontent
- Average volatile matter content

### Bituminous coal
- Includes the groups of high-, medium- and low-volatile bituminous coals
- Low water content
- Low O-content
- High C-content
- Average volatile matter content

### Anthracite
- Highest degree of coalification
- Very low water content
- Very low O-content
- Very high C-content
- Volatile content:
	- <14 % for semi anthracite
	- <10 % for anthracite
	- < 4 % for meta-anthracite


**Volatile Matter:** Matter that is transformed during pyrolysis
**Ash:** Matter that is inert and takes no part in combustion


## Analysis of hard coal
### Proximate analysis
- Volatile matter: 24 %
- Ash: 24 %
- Moisture: 2 %
- Fixed carbon: 50 %
- Calorific value: 16890 kJ/kg
### Chemical analysis
- Carbon: 80 %
- Hydrogen: 5 %
- Oxygen: 4 %
- Nitrogen: 1 %
- Sulphur: 1 %



## Oil genisis
### Diagenisis
- Rock formations sink and increase temperature and pressures
- biomass (kerogen) is converted to methane
- Methane is formed at low pressures and temperatures

### Catagenisis
- liquid hydrocarbons and methane escape from kerogen
- Process is called pyrolysis
- Oil and hydrocarbons are formed
- T = 50 째C ... 150 째C

### Metagenisis
- Hydrocarbons are cracked into smaller molecular chains
- T = 250 째C .... 350 째C

## Analysis of crude oil
### Elemental composition of crude oil:
- Carbon: 85 - 90 wt.%
- Hydrogen: 10-14 wt.%
- Sulphur: 0.1 - 3 wt.%
- Nitrogen: 0.1 - 0.5 wt.%
- Oxygen: 0-1.5 wt.%
- Heavy metals: 5-50 ppm
