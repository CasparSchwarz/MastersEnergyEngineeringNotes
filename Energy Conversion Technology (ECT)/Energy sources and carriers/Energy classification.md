## Primary energy
Energy sources as they occur in nature which have not undergone a conversion: 
- coals
- crude oil
- natural gas
- sunlight

## Secondary energy
Energy carriers obtained by converting primary energy sources, for example in a refinery; secondary energy carriers might also be tradeable as a final energy product (e.g. heating oil, gas, diesel)

## Final energy
Energy carriers obtained by end user (thermal energy, gasoline, heating oil, electricity)

## Usable energy
Energy available to the consumer after the last step of conversion (mechanical energy, thermal energy for cooking/heating, light, ...) -> electricity in itself usually _not_ usable without a conversion, that's why it's not considered to be a usable energy!

## Reserves
Part of the energy resources that is currently tehchnically and economically mineable (sufficiently low mining costs, marketable at cost-covering prices)

## Resources
All proven and expected energy deposits that are technically useable, even if they are currently not economically exploitable.
