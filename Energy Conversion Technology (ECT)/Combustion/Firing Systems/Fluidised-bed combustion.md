## Design / operation:
- By blowing combustion air into a bed of coal particles from below, the particle bed can be fluidised if the flow velocity is sufficient. This results in a self-mixing movement of the particles
- **Stationary fluidised bed:** At low air flow velocities, there is a balance between the weight force and the buoyancy force caused by the air flow; this is called a stationary fluidised bed. Such layers have a **high solid loading**
- **Circulating fluidised bed:** At high flow velocities, te entire bed is entrained and the particles are then separated behind the vortex chamber in a cyclone before the particle-free flue gas is directed to the boiler heating surfaces. The separated particles are returned to the fluidised bed. The mixing of the fluidised bed is higher here than in the stationary fluidised bed

The **addition of lime** to the fluidies bed incorporates
- sulphur,
- chlorine and
- fluorine compounds
into the ash and pollutant emissions are largely avoided.

## Advantages:
- Low pollutant emissions (due to low combustion temperature and the possibility of simple lime addition, NOx and sulphur can be significantly reduced by these primary measures)
- High temperature consistency due to high circulating solids mass (circulating fluidised bed)
- Good hot start behaviour (circulating fluidised bed)

## Disadvantages:
- Seperation cyclone and particle recirculation required (CFB)
- Poor cold start behaviour (CFB)
- Due to high bed dimensions, only low perfomance classes can be realized (CFB)
