## Design/operation:
- Coal is transported through the combustion chamber on a travelling grate
- The thickness of the carbon layer is adjusted by the layer thickness regulator
- Primary air (80-90 %) is fed into the combustion chamber at low flow rates from below by air control dampers through the grate / coal layer
- The ash is collected at the end of the conveyor belt and transported away
- The secondary air (10-20 %) is injected above the coal layer at high velocities to intensify the combustion
- Fresh air fan, induced draught fan and grate drive required
- Possibility of litter feeding for coals with a high proportion of small grain size

## Advantages:
- Clear system design and high availabilit
- Simple operation and low maintenance costs
- Low own consumption (blower and travelling grate)
- Relatively low NOx emissions
- Possibility of binding the fuel sulphur by adding lime
- Very flexible in terms of combustible fuels (waste incineration, combination of different coal types)

## Disadvantages:
- High firing loss (2-4 %)
- Air preheating only possible to a limited extent (primary air is used to cool the grate)
- Unsuitable for fine coals (minimum fuel grain size limited by grate fall-through)
- Risk of grate blockage due to melting metals and slag
- Wear of moving parts
- Due to the size of the grate, only small unit outputs (ca. 100 MW) can be realised
