## Design / operation:
- Coal is dried and ground outside the combustion chamber
- Through the burner, the pulverized coal is blown into the combustion chamber together with the combustion air and burnt in suspension
- Realisation of a quasi-gaseous combustion of the coal dust
- Design of the burners as jet or swirl or vortex burners
- grain size < 0,1 mm
- combustion temperature: 1200 °C - 1400 °C
- $P_{th}$ up to 2500 MW

## Advantages:
- Very good controllability of the firing rate
- Very good coal burnout due to high temperatures, thus low firing losses (<1 %)
- Air preheating well possible, thus also high final temperatures for feedwater preheating
- Good suitability for a wide range of fuels (also baking and moist coals as long as grindability is guaranteed)
- Good suitability for high output classes

## Disadvantages:
- High own consumption for mill and blower drives (1-2 & of $P_{el}$)
- High porportion of fly ash in the flue gases, therefore high effort for flue gas cleaning
