Requirements for combustion systems:
- Complete combustion of the fuel
- Wide control range with stable combustion
- Steep load change gradients in case of load changes
- High availability and low maintenance requirements
- Low pollutant emissions
- Easy removal of combustion residues

## Losses:
- Heat losses on furnace walls (0.2 % to 1 %)
- Flue gas losses; Heat still available in flue gas (6 % to 10 %)
- Firing losses (losses due to unburned fuel components)
	- grate firing: 2 % - 4 %
	- Fluidized bed (circulating) and dust firing ca. 0.5 %
- Loss due to sensible heat in ash and slag

##  Firing Systems:
- [[Dust or burner firing]]
- [[Fixed-bed or grate furnace]]
- [[Fluidised-bed combustion]]
