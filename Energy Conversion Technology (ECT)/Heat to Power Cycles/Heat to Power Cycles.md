Heat to power process generate mechanical energy from another energy form. Conservatively fossil fuels were used to generate mechanical energy in [[Thermal machines]]. These machines may work with nuclear energy or solar energy, too.

## Traditional PtH processes
### Carnot Cycle
The Carnot Cycle describes the maximum achievable efficiency and assumes heat supply and heat extraction at constant temperatures. The Carnot efficiency is often used as a benchmark for PtH processes.

### Clausius-Rankine Cycle
The Clausius-Rankine Cycle describes the process inside a conventional steam power plant. In this process the working fluid undergoes a phase-change through which a large amount of energy is converted. This cycle is a closed cycle, meaning the working fluid stays inside the power plant and constantly takes or supplies energy.

### Joule Cycle
The Joule Cycle describes the process inside a conventional gas power plant. In this process isobaric heat supply and heat extraction takes place, which is a lot more realistic than the Carnot Cycle. Unlike in the Clausius-Rankine Cycle the working fluid undergoes no phase-change. Furthermore the Joule Cycle is an open cycle, meaning air is taken from the environment and flue gas is emitted.

## Efficiency of the Heat to Power Cycles
### $\eta_{th} = \frac{P_{el}}{\dot{Q}_{in}}$

### Gas turbines

$\eta_{th}=\frac{w_{util}}{q_{in}}$

	$w_{util}=(1+\beta)\cdot w_T - W_C$
		$\beta = \frac{\dot{m}_F}{\dot{m}_a}$
	$q_{in}=\beta\cdot H_{LHV}$

### Combined Cycle Process
$\eta_{th-CCGT}=\eta_{th-GT}+\eta_{th-ST}\cdot\eta_{HRSG}\cdot(1-\eta_{th-GT})$
